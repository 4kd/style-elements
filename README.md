# Simplifying css for elm

It's easy to write _valid_ CSS that is still broken and frustrating.  What if we could just make frustrating CSS styles not expressible?

That's the aim of `style-elements` library. To give you the tools to write styles that are intuitive and robust, while still being productive and expressive.  To make styles that don't break.

And while we're at it, it wouldn't hurt to have built in support for `animations`, `transitions`, and `media queries` too.

Maybe styling can actually be _fun_ now.


#### Styling via pipes

```elm

import Style exposing (..)

title : Style.Model
title =
    Style.foundation
        |> width (px 300)
        |> height auto
```

#### Easy layout

```elm

container : Style.Model
container =
    Style.foundation
        |> flowLeft
            { wrap = True
            , horizontal = alignCenter
            , vertical = alignTop
            }
```


#### Animation

```elm
rotatingBox : Style.Model
rotatingBox =
    Style.foundation
        |> width (px 50)
        |> height (px 50)
        |> animate
            { duration = (5 * second)
            , easing = "linear"
            , repeat = forever
            , steps =
                [ ( 0, transforms [ rotate 0 0 0 ] )
                , ( 100, transforms [ rotate 0 0 (2 * pi) ] )
                ]
            }
```

#### Basic Introduction

__Building a style__

`Style.foundation` is your starting point, it has a number of default properties already set.  Think of it like a built-in css reset.

```elm

import Style exposing (..)

title : Style.Model
title =
    Style.foundation
        |> width (px 300)
        |> height auto
```


__Put that style in a stylesheet__

```elm

stylesheet : Style.StyleSheet msg
stylesheet =
    Style.render [ title ]

```

__Embed that stylesheet in your view and use it to render a style class__

```elm
view : Model -> Html msg
view model =
    div []
        [ Style.embed stylesheet
        , div [ stylesheet.class title ] []
        ]
```

But we didn't set a class, what class is it using?!

You can set a class to a style if you want, but if you don't then a class is automatically generated by taking the murmur3 hash of all the style properties in the style.



## Compared to elm-css

The goal of [elm-css](https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-css/) library is to provide access all of CSS in a typesafe way (meaning you get a beautiful compiler error if you write something incorrectly).  Part of the advantage comes from useing union types instead of strings to represent classes and ids.  This is inherently awesome and worth your consideration.


The `style-elements` library instead focuses on simplifying css, making it more robust and quicker to prototype in.

It does this by 
    * removing parts of css that cause the most trouble
    * setting smarter defaults
    * providing clean interfaces to the good parts like `media queries`, `flex-box` and `animations`.

It's meant to be a css preprocessor with css best practices built in, however this means that you have to understand and buy-in to what the `style-elements` library believes are best practices.
